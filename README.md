Gnome IRC is a very early work in progress of an IRC Client for the GNOME desktop. 
Currently it doesn't have many features.

## Running
You'll need a couple packages installed:

 * python-twisted
 * python 2.7
 * python-gi (for debian systems)
 
Once those are installed you have a couple of options to sue Gnome IRC

 * Run it locally - ./gnome-irc should be enough to run Gnome IRC without installing
 * If you wish to install it, run python setup.py install to install it on your PC
