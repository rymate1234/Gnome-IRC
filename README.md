Gnome IRC is a very early work in progress of an IRC Client for the GNOME desktop. 
Currently it doesn't have many features.

## Running
You'll need a couple packages installed:

 * python-twisted
 * python 2.7
 * python-gi (for debian systems)
 
Once those are installed just run main.py  - since it's python you don't need to compile anything!
