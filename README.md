# Gnome IRC

Gnome IRC is an IRC Client currently in the alpha stage of development. it is designed for the GNOME desktop, but should work on most linux desktops with the right libraries installed!

It's still early stages, but I've almost got the basics of an IRC client down! It even has support for ZNCs!

## Running
You'll need a couple packages installed:

 * python-twisted
 * python 2.7 (python 3 doesn't work)
 * python-gi (for debian systems)
 
Once those are installed you have a couple of options to use Gnome IRC

 * Run it locally - ./gnome-irc should be enough to run Gnome IRC without installing
 * If you wish to install it, run python setup.py install to install it on your PC
